## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this four card feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge. So if I've got something I'd like to practice, I can feel free to give it a go.

My users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## Goals

My goals for this project were to:

- [x] Use a mobile first approach
- [x] Code cleanly
- [x] Comment my code if I use a non-standard approach
- [x] Use CSS Variables
- [x] Use CSS Grid in combination with Flexbox to create the layout

I used this opportunity to further practice CSS grids and a mobile first approach meaning I started coding the CSS by coding the style for the mobile version first then moving up to the desktop design with conditional CSS.

## This was the design

## <a name="#what-i-learned"></a>What I learned

I keep learning things here and there in small increments every time I go through a challenge. I am getting to a point where my keyboard typing limitation is becoming an obstacle. I make constant typos and I need to learn to use the numbers located above the keys instead of using the numpad. I have decided to practice touch typing every day using https://www.typingstudy.com/

Specifically:

- I can use the gap property in a Flexbox
- I used the @font-face fule in CSS and load in fonts, because the font in question (Sparta) is no longer available through Google Fonts
- I used the self position properties of items located in a grid (justify-self, align-self, position-self) for the first time

## Tools used

- **VS Code** with a few extensions:
  - **CSS Peek** - To immediately see what certain variables that I set mean and their values by holding CRTL + hovering over the value
  - **HTML to CSS Autocompletion** - Quickly autocomplete classes and ID names in CSS based on what I created in HTML
  - **Live Preview** - Right-clicking the index.html offers to view a live and constantly auto-updated version of the web-page for a quick live view of one's work
- **Greenshot** - A fantastic little open-source tool that is like a screenshot on steroids. After pressing PrtScrn it lets one exactly measure the width and height of an element on a screen basically making it very easy to calculate how big certain margins, paddings, containers and font-sizes are in a design without having access to a wire-frame.
- **Microsoft PowerToys** - A nifty little program from Microsoft adding a *plethora* of UI functionality to Windows. What I use most for coding is CTRL+WIN+C it brings up a colour picker, and when I hover over something or click something it shows me the HEX, RGB, HSL and CMYK values of the colour that can instantly be copied to the clipboard and in addition to this it keeps a history of all the colours picked. Amazing!
